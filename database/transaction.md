# Transaction - ACID
A transaction is a set of related changes which is used to achieve some of the ACID properties.
Transactions are tools to achieve the ACID properties.

* Atomicity
Atomicity means that you can guarantee that all of a transaction happens, or none of it does

* Consistency
Consistency means that you guarantee that your data will be consistent

* Isolation
Isolation means that one transaction cannot read data from another transaction that is not yet completed

* Durability
Durability means that once a transaction is complete, it is guaranteed that all of the changes have been recorded to a durable medium (such as a hard disk), and the fact that the transaction has been completed is likewise recorded.
