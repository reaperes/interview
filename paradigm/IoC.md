# IoC vs DI
Both to remove dependencies of an application.

Inversion of control : Generic term and implemented in several ways (events, delegates etc).
Dependency injection : DI is a subtype of IOC and is implemented by constructor injection, setter injection.

> Tip by spring
To use constructors for mandatory dependencies
To use setter methods or configuration methods for optional dependencies.
