##What is python really?
* Python is an interpreted language like ruby, JavaScript. It does not need to be compiled before it is run.
* Python is dynamically typed.
* Python is well suited to object orientated programming. "We are all adults here" so, python does not have access specifiers - public, private.
* Functions are first-class objects. This means that they can be assigned to variables, returned from other functions and passed into functions. Classes are also first class objects.
* Writing Python code is quick but running it is often slower than compiled languages. Fortunatelyï¼ŒPython allows the inclusion of C based extensions so bottlenecks can be optimized away and often are. The `numpy` package is an example.
